Anyone familiar with the Raspberry Pi Pico development boards, has likely seen the various HAT *(Hardware Attached on Top)* accessory boards. If you are like us, you've likely run into a simple design limitation with the HATs; they can only be connected in a single orientation!

Whether a HAT is attached above or below a Raspberry Pi Pico, they all have a fixed orientation. At SparkFun, we have come up with at simple solution to this problem, the SparkFun Pico Add-On Flipper for XRP. Our Pico Add-On Flipper takes the standard pin out for any Raspberry Pi Pico development board and flips it over, as if you had physically rotated the board over *(facing down)*.

How is this useful? Say you have a project that uses a Raspberry Pi Pico development board and:

- the board must be in a specific orientation to access its USB connector. However, the wiring or connections to the perfect HAT for your project is on the wrong side. With the Pico Add-On Flipper, you can *flip* those connections from the right-side of the USB port over to the left-side *(or vise-versa)*.
- the perfect HAT for your [Experiential Robotics Platform (XRP) kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/experiential-robotics-platform-xrp-kit.html), is not intended to be *attached on top* of the Pico, but underneath it. For example, a display board where the screen faces downward. With the Pico Add-On Flipper, you can take the *(hardware attached on the bottom)* display board and flip it over, so that it can be mounted as a **HAT** *(above the Pico with the screen facing upwards)*.

Additionally, we also provide a Qwiic connector and reset button on the edges of the Pico Add-On Flipper that users can easily access.
