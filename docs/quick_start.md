-    Whether you are working with the PICO or the XRP, the SparkFun Pico Add-On Flipper Board provides flexibility when space is at a premium. Whereas most Pico add-on boards are designed to go on the bottom of a Pico with male headers, the XRP has female headers on top. This board enables users to flip those add-on boards to be on top of the XRP. Should you wish to use the SparkFun Pico Add On Flipper Board in non-XRP applications, we've also included a Qwiic connector and reset button.
